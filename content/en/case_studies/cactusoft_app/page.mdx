Cactusoft is a company building the first fully integrated construction site management platform in Quebec, active since 2008. The platform offers a wide range of powerful tools to manage the entire construction process, including quotes management, dispatch, worker schedules, pay, and much more. The company was in need of a Lead UX Designer and, considering my experience and past internship with them, I was selected to fill that position in late August 2024.

For protective reasons, the company keeps most of their processes private, but I'll do my best to share my experience nonetheless. 

## Context

Cactusoft's application was evolving rapidly to meet ongoing customer requests. As a small company, the challenge was less about vision and more about giving developers the tools they needed to focus on their core skill: implementation, guided by a clear and thoughtful design system.

With limited resources and time, UX became a balancing act—finding simple solutions to complex problems while driving a major redesign to modernize the application. My role was to support developers with reusable designs, provide clarity on feature upgrades, and create a path forward that delivered immediate value while laying the foundation for future unification.

## Objectives

1. **Improve navigation and mental models**  
   - Reorganize features and how they are presented  
   - Rethink the navigation system to better reflect application state  
   - Enhance interactions to establish clearer hierarchy  

2. **Modernize the interface**  
   - Redesign core sections using the latest design system  
   - Address system limitations and document best practices  

3. **Unify and extend features**  
   - Lead ideation for major feature refactors  
   - Define strategies to integrate new features into legacy parts of the app with minimal overhead  
   - Bundle related features to increase perceived user value  

4. **Strengthen the design system & developer efficiency**  
   - Reduce user cognitive load through improved information hierarchy  
   - Integrate components and modules into Storybook for consistency  
   - Standardize design with reusable variables, purpose-based color palettes, and a unified icon set  

5. **Design for all users, not just customer segments**  
   - Prioritize solutions that create value across the full customer base  

## Process

I began with an audit of existing workflows and UI inconsistencies to identify the biggest pain points. From there, I restructured the navigation to better reflect the users's mental models and created prototypes to validate the new flows.  

In parallel, I created reusable Figma components, variables and colors, giving developers who were still mostly autonomous in the design process at the time, reusable building blocks and clear guidelines. To support rapid delivery, I prioritized quick wins while designing a migration path for legacy parts of the app.  

Finally, I modernized the visuals with new palettes and a unified icon set, and documented everything in practical guides so developers could adopt the system smoothly.

## Result

1. **Developer efficiency improved**
   - Reusable components, tokens, and documented guidelines reduced friction and greatly sped up implementation.  
2. **Navigation clarity increased**
   - Negative feedback related to the user navigation almost completely stopped, replacing critique with feature ideas.  
3. **Modernized experience**
   - Redesigned core sections gave the app a fresh, consistent look aligned with the new design system.  
4. **Future-ready foundation**
   - Migration paths, a unified icon set, and Storybook integration created scalability for ongoing growth.  
5. **Company-wide value**
   - Features were designed with all customer types in mind, improving adoption across the user base.
