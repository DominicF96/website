I've been on both sides of the table. An interview is a certainly a stressful process, therefore it's normal for people to behave in a way they wouldn't normally. For some, an interview is a matter of paying rent or not, for some others, it's much less critical.

Either way, there's a lot going on in a person's mind during that process and it's normal to make mistakes, but some of those are much harder to fix. I'll outline some of the worst mistakes I've seen people do during interviews.

## You're Both Looking for a Fit

You want to work with nice people you can relate to. Your interviewer is the same.

Don't play the pretend game, be yourself and see how it goes. You'll both see if it works or not and save yourself some time if it's simply not meant to be.

You won't be happy in a team you don't relate to and they likely won't think like you. Save yourself the trouble and avoid that job.

## Trust your Interviewer

If they want to play games and try and trick you during the interview, personally I'd run away. So I really have no reason to believe the interviewer wants to trick me and if they do, that's a red flag. When I've interviewed people, I wanted them to succeed, I wouldn't try to trick them.

As an interviewer, I find it much more valuable to have someone express their thoughts process than to try and see if they can spot my shenanigans.

Most jobs require you to trust others and make the right decisions with the information you're given, not avoid trickery. That may be useful in some jobs, but certainly not the majority.

## Know the Job you're Applying For

I know how it sounds, but please bear with me. Of course, you know the title you're applying for, but do you really know what the job is all about? Make sure to read the entire job offer, are you confident it's accurate and complete?

Sometimes the hiring process is rushed and those descriptions are somewhat off. Please make sure that it's accurate with the interviewer to make sure you won't have any surprise responsibility.

The interviewer is likely the one best knowing the job he's hiring for. It shouldn't be your job to do that, but that'll save you some trouble and as an interviewer, I'd see this as interest for the job so it's a plus.

## Be Ready to Adress any Weakness in Your Resume

That happened to me when we interviewed a mother who took 2 years off to spend time with her new baby. A very good reason and no interviewer should penalize a mother for taking her role seriously. Her experience was not relevant to our job offer so it would've hardly been a match, but I thought it was a horrible spot to be in if you can't justify it. So here we are.

You're applying in a rapidly changing field and you took a few years to travel the world? Cool! Tell me what you gained from it and how I can trust that your prior education/experience is still relevant. You don't want to leave your interviewer thinking your skills are obsolete.

If you have a hard time justifying that weakness, you might want to compensate elsewhere. For a software developer role, for example, showing off a recent project you've built with recent technologies can certainly do the trick.

## A Salary Happily Received and Given

To me, a job is a relationship that is mutually beneficial. That means that of course, the company will pay you to be there and work, but you have to make sure that the salary you're negotiating is fair for both parties.

If you despise going to work because you think that you're worth more, then your relationship will suffer, the inverse is true too.

An interview is usually the first time you'll meet your potential future employer. That means that at that point, you know your worth much better than them.

Don't accept a salary under your expectations (if you can afford it) and ask questions if the salary is much higher than what you had in mind, there might be responsibilities you didn't expect from the job description.

Don't forget to take into account any expenses you are expected to pay yourself (let's say you're working on deliveries and you're expected to use your car and pay for the gas).

Before closing this post, I'd like to do a dishonorable mention to; being sober. I hate to mention it, but it happened.

### Finally…

A job is a mutually beneficial relationship. Both parties should be able to thrive and grow from it. That relationship will start to suffer when either party is dissatisfied, having regular checkups with your manager is extremely important for both of you.

For you, of course, it's the perfect time to discuss the tasks that you dislike, the salary, and potential promotions. For them, making sure you're happy and productive will help them get more value from your time.

Good luck in your next interview!
